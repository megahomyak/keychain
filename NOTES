How this should work:

=== ENCRYPTION ===

encryption-algo1:...:encryption-algo2:...

->

First, we encrypt the input data using encryption-algo1. Then, we pass that encrypted block to encryption-algo2 as if it's the original input data. If we're decrypting and not encrypting, we should just go backwards and do decryptions

=== SIGNING ===

signing-algo1:...

->

When signing, we do this: [data] -> [data][SOME SORT OF SEPARATOR][signature]. When checking the signature, we divide by the separator and thus get everything for other steps
